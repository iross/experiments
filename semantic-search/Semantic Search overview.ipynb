    "# xDD - Semantic Search proof-of-concept\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The current xDD articles endpoint provides phrase (default) matching, bag-of-words (with `match` parameter), and the ability to extend the search to title and abstract fields (with boosted scoring for relevance). Scoring is the Elasticsearch default (BM25 as of ES5). \n",
    "\n",
    "We have prototyped a [MPNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09297) LM-backed search. Thanks to Brandon, David-Andrew, and Joel for providing an implementation of an MPNet embedder and for providing guidance on the query structure! Each document is embedded, with the resulting vector stored in Elasticsearch. Queries are similarly embedded, and an exhaustive search is done to retrieve nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Qualitative) Results\n",
    "Unsurprisingly, the semantic search does really well with general free-text type queries of the type \"adding age stratification to a covid-19 model\". Also unsurprisingly, it also suffers for very specific out-of-vocabulary queries of the type \"SVIIVR\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaways\n",
    "It's very promising! Establishing quantitative metrics is obviously important for determining whether it *really* improves the search. The question of how to handle out-of-vocabulary searches remains, but overall it was a successful experiment worth pursuing furthure. And there are a lot of directions we could go with (L)LMs..\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"exhaustive search\" is a potential pain point that can be sidestepped by upgrading to ES8, which includes performance updates.\n",
    "    - Filtering to only sets of documents can also help until the upgrade\n",
    "- Currently only the xdd-covid-19 set has been embedded.\n",
    "- This approach also lends itself well to \"nearby document\" explorations\n",
    "    - And \"nearby artifacts,\" once implemented.\n",
